# SKU Generator Application
## Tyler Varzeas 2023

This application was designed to test my ability to perform to tasks:

  1. Create an application that is unique, functional, and incredibly useful.
  2. Creat an application that is responsive accross multiple screen resolutions and devices.

Both of these goals were achieved in this application. The inspiration for this app came from working on website and loyalty program updates at a family member's pet store. While browsing through the Shopify UI for store owners and the store inventory, I noticed there were a few issues with the prices not matching online and in store. I did some digging and realized it is because the two software being used to track inventory where not communicating due to **no SKU numbers being created.**

This led to the store inventory software not recognizing the price adjustments on Shopify since there were no numbers to match the items up to. Due to this, customers were beginning to price check items in store because the online shop reflected a different price.

This application makes it easier for small business owners to quickly generate as many SKU numbers as they would like, at there desired specifications.
